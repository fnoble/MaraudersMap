## MCR (Mission Concept Review)

*What is the need, objectives and concept for meeting said objectives?*

This project aims to build a self-contained person tracker and locator for use in venues such as Burning Man. 

Bushwack is:

- A completely homogenous, decentralized position reporting system.
- A mesh network for sharing locations of people and points-of-interest.
- A small, cheap (<$50 hopefully!) handheld device.


## SRR (System Requirements Review)

*What is the functional and performance requirements for the system?*

**Hardware:**

Each unit has:

- a GPS for positioning
- a compass for orientation
- a small screen for information display
- a few buttons for interaction
- a rechargeable, long-lasting battery
- some storage for points of interest
- a small digital radio
- - doesn't depend on pairing with another device

**Mesh Network:**

- Data
- 

## SDR (System Design Review)

*What is the proposed system architecture and design, and the flow of data through the system?*
