```WELCOME! THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL, UNTESTED, IN-PROGRESS PRE-ALPHA PROJECT! THAT BE DRAGONS AHEAD YET LADDY!```

## MCR - Mission Concept Review

*What is the need, objectives and concept for meeting said objectives?*

At large outdoor venues, such as Burning Man, it is easy to lose your friends, and difficult to locate them again. Often this is a *good* thing since it leads to serendipidous adventures and a forced relaxation of scheduling stress. Often, though, it's a source of stress and frustration. 

This project aims to build a cheap, self-contained person locator.

## SRR - System Requirements Review

*What is the functional and performance requirements for the system?*

Bushwack needs to be:

- A completely homogenous, decentralized position reporting system.
- A mesh network where the typical communication scheme is NOT all-to-all, but might be.
- Stand-alone, with no dependency on wifi or cell signals.
- A small, cheap (ideally <$50) handheld device.
- Weather-resistant in dusty and extreme temperature environments.
- Resilient to power-cycling

## SDR - System Design Review

*What is the proposed system architecture and design, and the flow of data through the system?*

**Hardware:**

Each unit has:

- a GPS for positioning
- a compass for orientation
- a small screen for information display
- a few buttons for interaction
- a rechargeable, long-lasting battery
- some storage for points of interest
- a small digital radio
- - doesn't depend on pairing with another device

**Mesh Network:**

- Data
